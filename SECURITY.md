# ShelterConnect GitHub Security Policy

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the ShelterConnect GitHub repository! ShelterConnect is a software application designed to support local immigration and homeless shelter services. This security policy outlines the practices and protocols to ensure the safety, integrity, and confidentiality of our codebase and data.

## 2. Access Control

### 2.1 Repository Access
- **Repository Types**: ShelterConnect uses both public and private repositories.
  - **Public Repository**: Open for viewing by everyone but contributions are managed through pull requests.
  - **Private Repository**: Access restricted to invited collaborators and team members.

- **Roles and Permissions**:
  - **Admin**: Full control over repository settings, including access management.
  - **Maintain**: Can manage repository settings, issues, and pull requests.
  - **Write**: Can push changes to the repository and manage issues and pull requests.

### 2.2 Authentication
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: All collaborators must enable 2FA on their GitHub accounts for enhanced security.
